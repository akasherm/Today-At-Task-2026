        : - Send tasks from Desktop to phone / tablet as a json file.
        : - Email tasks to phone.
        : - Update some data on load instead of having to upload through Play Store.

        : Coding Process Updates
        : - Use dimension flavours to set up multiplpe environments using one code base.




Planned New Features:
- Push notifications.
- Task backup to json file that can be reloaded. This feature must use a format that will
  remain the same across versions so that data can be recovered if there's a breaking 
  change again like switching databases.




Questions:
- Is the database even needed? Could a json file be used and stored locally on the device?
- Could Firebase be used instead? - This would require Internet access.
