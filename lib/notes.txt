Planned New Features:
- Push notifications.
- Task backup to json file that can be reloaded. This feature must use a format that will
  remain the same across versions so that data can be recovered if there's a breaking 
  change again like switching databases.




Questions:
- Is the database even needed? Could a json file be used and stored locally on the device?
- Could Firebase be used instead? - This would require Internet access.
