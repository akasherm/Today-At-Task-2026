Project Working Title: Today At Task 2026
               Author: Sherm
              Created: 05 October 2025

This version is primarily to meet the new target requirements of Google. 
To take advantage of the update, new features that were planned for version 2 will also be implemented.
Additionally, the app will switch from using Hive for record keeping, to SQLlite.

The original plan was to try to capture existing tasks and move them over. Instead, the app will just use SQLlite from
the onset.
